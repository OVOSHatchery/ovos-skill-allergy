Allergy report for my husband David

## About

Everyday, mycroft will send an allergy level report base on your zipcode to you for being aware of the air quality. 
When you ask how are the allergies today/tomorrow, it tells you the digit number of the allergies and allergy levels for today/tomorrow
Will use IP Address to determining the current address(if you use VPN, it doesn't work) 
## Examples
* "How's the allergy today"
* "What's the allergy level today"
* "Will i feel bad today?"
* "Do i need to be aware of the allergy for tomorrow"
